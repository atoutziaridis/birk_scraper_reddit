pros and cons,why birk?,thoughts on birk,are they buy it for life?,bad post 
"Cons: the first few shifts wearing them.","Bostons to work everyday, EVA flip flop looking things for walking the dog, Arizona for going to the store, errands etc. Disclaimer: I’m old and don’t care what people think. I just want to be comfortable.","I’m in my 40’s but live in the PNW where Birkenstocks are very common. The classic 2 strap is probably the most acceptable and also iconic.","To be honest I love my birks, but no they are not. It’s expensive to resole them and record them. so I just wear mine into the ground and buy another at roughly the same cost.","I agree 1,000,000%"
"Pros: every shift after that.","With age comes wisdom!","The only issue are the tan lines!","It honestly looks not hard to do it yourself though. I’d bet you can resole and rework a pair yourself for ~45$ if you look into it but I don’t have time lately","Not all footwear works for everyone, and if it doesn’t work for you, it doesn’t mean they are bad shoes, or that there’s something wrong with your feet. Sometimes you need to seek out something else to achieve a similar look."
"This comment is the best explanation. My feet weren’t too happy with me for about two weeks while breaking in mine, but after that break in, they are fantastic! They are solid and firm, so you never have that walking-on-clouds feeling, but after 12hrs on my feet they aren’t sore and aching and I’m a heavy guy.","This is the way","Yeah that makes sense and if I was in the PNW, this might be less of a question for me. I live in the middle of North Carolina. I see plenty of people wearing them in Asheville, but it’s a little more stuffy where I live unfortunately.","Yeah my Birks typically last 4-5 years per pair, I wear them down until the sole is almost shot and the cork is really starting to fall apart. I’m actually due for a new pair and I’m pretty sure my MIL got me new ones for my bday next week cuz she likes to do that lol","I’m a runner, and just don’t jive with Nike, Adidas, or Puma, but love me some Hokas, Saucony, and New Balance. Even within the brands that work for me, can’t necessarily wear all their shoe models."
"Link This and I have a commercial medical foot massager that I use whenever I get home. I just dropped the link. I got mine from Costco and have worked in a hospital. I wasn't interested at getting it at first but I got one for my mother as she's 61. When I tried it at Costco I was actually impressed with how my feet felt.","EVAs are great in wet weather.","From Georgia and familiar with stuffy. Wear the Birks, just know they’re not for every occasion.","Agree. Love my Birks but I wear them excessively all summer for long nature walks and daily use, sometimes they get wet etc and I usually only get two years out of them and it's too expensive where I live to get them resoled.","Your last sentence is so true!! For me, with Birks, some models just do not work for my feet, including Gizeh and Bend low. I've had the best success with my Bostons and Floridas. It took a lot of trial and error for me."
"Got a link?","Did we just become best friends?","Thanks. That makes sense, and yeah if I was going some place less casual I’d at least throw on my Sperry Mocs.","Not BIFL but 5-10 years is realistic if you take care of them. the heel sole wears out first for me, so what I started doing is replacing the heel with a hard rubber replacement once it gets close to cork. very easy DIY with barge cement. Also, keeping up to date on cork sealer is important","I was talking about how much I loved my new bend lows to a friend of mine. She said she’s had a pair of Arizonas for years that still are not comfortable for her. Sounded to me like she’s in between sizes and can’t get a good fit. Birks are comfy right out of the box for me every time. They just aren’t made for everyone’s feet."
"Seconded","i wear them anywhere, sometimes even without pants!","I live in Raleigh and rock them year-round. Londons in the winter and Zurichs or Arizonas when it's warm.","Resole and re-corking a Birkenstock is everything except the straps. You're replacing like 90% of the shoe, just buy a new one lol",""
"Drop That Link","Livin' the dream 🙏","Been in the triangle for a few years now and never seen another dude with Birks on. It’s always those god awful Hey Dude’s.","I’d say so. I’ve had the same pair for years and they only get more comfortable. You probably already know this but they have restaurant specific Birkenstocks.",""
"Link","I wear them everywhere and have numerous pairs for all occasions. I’m in a colder climate so my Boston’s get the most wear, then I have patent black leather, blue suede, brown leather, pink suede and white EVA Arizonas that I rotate. My current ‘good’ pair are the pink suede, but last year it was the blue suede. I wear my EVAs for the beach or gardening etc as easily cleaned - they’re also super comfy. I also have Birkenstock Chelsea boots for winter and basically all other shoes are uncomfortable sooooo I’m stuck with em forever.","And all the bitches you have to fend off","Ok thanks for the answer",""
"Was gonna try and write something that would say these exact sentiments. Woulda been too long. This comment was much better.","My husband used to have a pair of the EVAs but he didn't like them, made his feet sweat and felt slippery not as comfortable I guess.","I like them, would recommend the Arizona (2 strap) or the Boston (clog/mule).","how do you deal with the smell?",""
"I used to wear Birk London but had the same issue. I started buying them a few weeks before I needed to replace them at work and would break them in at home, a couple of hours at a time. I found this to be FAR better than breaking them in at work and suffering for a week.","I actually had no idea how expensive these sandals were, I was thinking of getting him a pair of EVAs to have specifically for beach and stuff and maybe another new pair he can keep as a dressier pair.","I Wear them with socks most of the time. Goes great with more casual clothes","i wear them without socks, and feet often sweat. i noticed after a year that the odor was horrible.",""
"I always keep my old shoes in my car and switch halfway through the shift. Breaking them in at home beforehand will now become part of that process","Oh to live in Hawaii and Birkenstocks 🥰💭🌴🍹","Yeah, based on what I’m seeing here I think if I did go the Birks it would be the Arizona style.","i tried to use a vinegar solution, to wipe away the bacteria/smell, but that only put a vinegar smell that was stronger than the odor for a small amount of time.",""
"This one’s the best and simplest explanation. First 1-2 weeks wearing them made me want to fight the guy at the birk store, but once they’re broken in they’re some of the best kitchen shoes","I have a pair I wear exclusively as house shoes, another pair I wear casually and like other folks mentioned on here, when the degrees dip I switch my Arizonas in for some Bostons. Would wear them to work, if I could. Sometimes with socks, sometimes without.","Do not wear the Arizonas with socks!!!!!","Odor causing bacteria like damp, warm places. So you would think cold and dry would be the remedy like a user suggested below, but in my experience while that may neutralize some of the odor, the bacteria that causes the odor is actually fairly resistant to cold temperatures.",""
"Pros: Best and most comfortable kitchen shoes possible.","Everywhere. Except the beach/pool/water. Only EVAs or other flip flops (usually Olukai).","Don’t worry, I’ve never been a fan of the sandals and socks look.","You’re much better off getting them dry quickly with heat, like with a blow dryer. Additionally, stuff newspaper inside to help with moisture, and some baking soda for odors.",""
"Cons: The little black lattices of kitchen shit that for some reason you will leave behind you like a greasy Hansel & Gretel.","I wear them basically everywhere but the gym because all other shoes hurt my feet and if I could wear them to the gym I would.","Arizona’s with sock is the way in most situations, ain’t no body want to see your dogs, keep that for the beach haha","If that doesn’t work, I’d skip vinegar and use 90% rubbing alcohol or bottom shelf (unflavored) vodka in a spray bottle where you can adjust the stream that comes out. I’ve found the alcohol smell fades much faster than the vinegar smell",""
"Also make sure you have the back strap tight enough, I find over time the leather stretches and I always end up having to make a new hole in the strap.","Pretty much everywhere, every day Spring, Summer and Fall. I do have Bostons for winter but I also have some decent boots from other brands that work well enough for winter. However, even in winter, I wear my Birk sandals at home.","I’m learning a lot of people have a hang up about feet. It’s so interesting. Maybe it’s a cultural thing? People around here wear open toe shoes all the time.","I use vodka as needed and I have worn birks more than half the time over the past 2 decades",""
"You won't leave trails of kitchen shit if the floor is clean","Anytime I am in shorts and t shirt, I’m in them.","Birkenstocks are great as long as you can pull them off imo. They can swing between looking very fashionable and 'retired German tourist' depending on your personal style. Personally I really like the Kyotos and the Boston.","","It could be the model as well. I hate the Madrid (single strap) as I feel like they’re really unstable and flap around. My current faves are Mayari as they stay on my feet well and are comfy even though I have a massive bunion which hurts when I wear my Arizonas even though they’re really well broken in."
"Lol that's just not true. Stuff falls during rushes, you step on it. Unless you're doing a line sweep every 5 minutes you get stuff in your shoes.","That includes casual outings and just daily strolls. Now, I wouldn’t wear them to work or any setting where closed toe shoes are required!","Yes. Also... not a big feet fan.","","Definitely depends on the model. For me, the best and most secure fit is with the Floridas. They just stay on my feet better, and are the most comfortable (probably because they only come in regular width, and I've found the Bostons fit me in narrow but other models don't)."
"I found that buying them in a smaller size than my regular shoes helped a lot with this as well.","This is where the Boston comes in my friend","The look above? No thanks. The original bricks with shorts are ok tho","Put them in ziplock bags and then put them in the freezer overnight? I do that with my kids dance shoes (she got some stinky dogs). I don’t know though if freezing will have a negative impact on the cork though","Arizona in suede are softer for a bunion, I love mine!"
"Con : price Pro : everything else. I wore mine every day for 3 years. It got to a REALLY bad state... Took it to a cobbler, i swear it gained an extra 2 years. You can't repair cheap plastic shit.","I probably won’t wear Bostons to work!","Birks are elite. With or without socks. Comfy AF. Don’t listen to the haters, they are probably wearing crocs.","Sand the top layer of grime off with fine-grit sandpaper. Lots of resources online to help with this. It makes the footbed feel brand new.","I had a pair of Arizona suede and they were great but the actual footbed edge is what was rubbing my bunion more than the upper. But I really like the look and feel of suede!"
"But you can buy a new pair of crocs every year and a half for like 15 bucks!","I wear them everywhere, pretty much 90% of the time, every day, unless it’s raining. Mine just get more molded to my feet and more comfortable - the pair I’ve had longest I’ve had for maybe…10 years? They still look pretty good. I also have a pair of my grandpa’s from the late 80s and they’re still intact.","I will not accept them being worn in the gym or in the rain. There is a line.","I really want to try Birkenstocks but I suffer from hyper-hydrosis and I hear the two don’t mix.","It goes both ways. Universally good, universally bad."
"Tell that to your spine and knees in a few decade","(I have a pair of EVA Arizonas for wearing if I know they’ll get wet but I still wear my leather ones to the beach, I just don’t put wet feet in them).","Crocs are the greatest footwear invention of all time. Bring on the down votes","I have hyperhydrosis as well, my birks are my favorite shoes! I’ve got Bostons and Arizonas and I haven’t had smell issues with either.","Some people are unwilling to break in shoes. If they don't fit perfect right out of the box, or the leather needs to stretch a bit, they can't deal. The slightest inconvenience is an insurmountable barrier. Sometimes the straps are too tight or too loose, but no, \"all Birkenstocks are uncomfortable!\""
"You literally spend more time on your feet than you do in your bed as a cook. Do not cheap out on your footwear. Invest in your feet and your feet will pay you back ten fold into your knees and back","Smart about the wet feet! My husband goes through them quickly not due to the water he just wears the soles right off them down to the cork. There is one place that resoles birks here but its as expensive as a new pair, so unless you're extremely attached to a certain pair for comfort or sentimental reasons - there is no reason ro resole rather than just replace.","I own crocs and they’re definitely useful when it’s wet or in the yard, but they’re far from fashionable.","I have insanely sweaty feet to the point where if I wear my normal non synthetic leather shoes for more than a day consecutively, you can smell them from across the room. Although, I haven't been officially diagnosed with hyperhidrosis.","That being said, people have different feet, gait patterns, all sorts of things that make one brand or model more comfortable or durable. People will over pronate and wear out a shoe differently and declare that the quality of that brand is terrible for everyone. No, it doesn't suit *your* feet."
"Always invest in things that separate your body from ground!","Crazy when i hear people having their birks this long because I've never saw them as long lasting shoes (due to the soles).","Honestly, I made fun of crocs and then dated a girl who wore them and she bought me some for Christmas one year. They’re pretty fucking awesome and useful daily","I now wear my Birks almost every day and haven't noticed any smell, but i'm not putting them right up to my nose either. I also haven't had any issue with slippage unless I happen to be outside in the rain, but even then, it's not too bad. I actually find my feet sweat a lot less than normal because of how open they are.","I miss the days when shoe stores would pay people enough to guide customers through buying and breaking in shoes."
"Crocs are trash knockoff versions of the real thing (these)!","Common in my family to have the same pair for years and years and years! We walk a lot too. But we’re in California, it’s quite dry ya know?","","If you have more than one pair, rotate your usage and let each pair dry out completely between wears. No smell or grossness for me.","I wore mine for a year and they are not for me. That's ok at least I know not to buy another pair. I am sticking with my brooks glycerin. Like walking on marshmallow clouds."
"Pretty sure everyone here knows how CHEAP crocs are.","After the first pair gets worn enough that it looks older it will just become like, the casual pair lol. I have a pair of Madrids I use as my slightly dressier pair.","I just bought myself some for my upcoming vacay and spring/summer attire. Bought the classic Arizona style. Clean looking for when you want something quick to put on.","Leather care of the suede foot bed, wash the vegan ones.","I'm giving birks a try and so far one pair feels good and another gave me a blister. :-(. I do love my Brooks Ghost, tho'. But I need sandals for the summer."
"Cons: \"What are thoooose?!\"","Is this due to improper care/getting wet? This is after about 1 year of wear on my husbands arizonas..","I recommend breaking them in a bit before you plan on wearing them on vacation. For example you don’t wanna be breaking them in on a boardwalk. They don’t take long to break in and they’re perfect once they are","The smell is from Birkenslime which isn’t a problem if you keep them dry","For summer, i bought a pair of ohana olukais, and i am breaking them in. They are supposed to be very comfortable."
"The owner of the restaurant I am at now has a daughter that is disabled and limited in her verbal skills. We always joke around and one day she asked to see my phone, looked up a picture of bozo the clown and told me that that is what I look like. Ya it hurt.","Oh idk honestly I haven’t had any type of damage that severe to mine! The worn away tread is what I experience primarily as far as wear and tear.","Good advice. Thanks","","I’ll check those out. Thanks!"
"Boom! Roasted","Yeah perhaps it's just different people walking differently, that's still wild to me! For the price that's awesome. Do you regularly have them resoled?","For example you don’t wanna be breaking them in on a boardwalk","","I realize that I have a pair of those! I wore them non stop in Australia. They’re more of a flip flop than sandal but I did not have to break them in at all. Thanks for the reminder."
"Been wearing mine religiously for 3 years, both styles. I will say this it has good amount of break in period but once it’s broken in it fits perfectly. If you are deck scrubbing you might get your socks wet ( I always carry a extra clean pair) and if you are a messy cook or have messy coworkers the second a stray tomato or noodle squishes between the outsoles you lose some traction but overall one of my favorite pairs. Price wise I was always told skimp on your clothes and knives but never skimp out on your shoes, comfortable shoes “prevents” back pain","Nope, I haven’t had any of them resoled! I wouldn’t be surprised if my grandpa’s had been resoled at some point though, his are ollllld.","Why not? Does it require a hard surface like concrete pavements?","Yep! You can get them recorked, Re-strapped, and re-buckled at most cobblers out there. I know the cobbler I brought mine to said Birks were his bread and butter, and all of the Goodyear welt repairs etc are the gravy.","I'd never thought I'd hear this from someone else. That is exactly how I thought every time I see someone asking why they can't get a good fit no matter what they try to do. Some think that it'll eventually mold in and fit. That's not how it works. If it fits the person from the beginning, then it works out better sure, but if it never fits them from the beginning no matter how hard they try it means birks are not meant for whoever is trying them on."
"I'm struggling with this right now, I wear Crocs and my body is destroyed as of late. Do birks actually protect feet, joints, and back? They seem so uninvolved, being that they're cork platforms","(ETA I will eventually have to have my regular Arizonas resoled since they’re losing their tread!)*","No I just mean the process of breaking them isn’t exactly comfortable, so a lot of walking around (as is typical for walking a boardwalk) would not be the best place to break them in. The way I broke mine in was just wearing them everywhere that it wouldn’t bother me too much. Like going to the store and things like that.","Bread and butter would mean he makes a lot of money from them. It sounds like on repairs.","I think people come in to complain (hi, it’s me) because we are always told be Birkenstock diehards that they love them."
"Your body probably needs more than a pair of shoes. Do your self a huge favor and go on YouTube, type in stretches for “where it hurts”, and try and do them before, after, and during your shift. Heel pulls can help a ton for lower back and asscheek pain.","Your husband is not the only one. I wear mine out like crazy too. The heel part of the soles of my birks wear out in a season when I lived in NYC and was walking all the time. I had bostons for winter and gizehs for summer and always had to buy a new pair every year. I am so jealous of people who have theirs for years! Now that I’m walking less my body hates me but my shoes are lasting longer.","My God, this sub should be called the anti-fashion sub.","possibly, but more likely they mean it was a typical job","I talk to my friends about wanting a new pair of shoes, they tell me I’ll never want to take off a pair of Birks. I compliment someone’s Birks, and they tell me they are the best shoes they’ve ever had. I ask my doctor about caring for my feet, they tell me I should try Birks."
"This is a great video. Get your coworkers to stretch when they complain about their pains.","Yeah I never really thought to read about them until check reddit until the other day. Its wild to me because I've always thought of them as \"very comfortable but not at all durable\" i have some athletic sandals with vibram soles and those soles are a much harder material and don't wear nearly as quickly, I suppose i dont really wear them as often on pavement either usually more on unpaved nature trails which are realistically easier on the shoe.","Given the comments so far, I’m honestly not sure which camp you’re in but I love that I apparently found a men’s fashion holy war.","one they could do quickly and with quality","I think you see complaints here frequently because Birkenstock has the worst return policy. For a shoe that requires (most) people break them in, you can’t return/exchange shoes with ANY wear on them. I spent $150 on mine, wore for about three days and had a flare up of my chronic back pain. I reached out to Birkenstock customer support about exchanging for the soft footbed and while my agent was absolutely lovely, she told me I was SOL."
"Check your stance every time you do a stationary task like prep. Distribute your weight evenly on both feet with them lined up with your shoulders. When you put all your weight on one foot it starts to hurt faster, then you switch to the other, and now both of your dogs are barking with hours to go in your shift.","I am really curious because people say they walk a lot. If the weather has to do with the sole degradation here.","That’s a no from me.","Yes that is what I/they meant.","Maybe I just don’t have it like you have it, and that’s no shade to you, but $150 is a lot for a pair of sandals. They came highly recommended by everyone I’d spoken to. I came to this subreddit to do research. I don’t have a high or low arch. I went into a shoe store for sizing. And then when I wasn’t satisfied I received the nicest “fuck you” a customer support agent could give me. It was really frustrating and it honestly made me super sad."
"Make good meal decisions. Garbage in garbage out.","A good reason for resoling for me is reducing environmental impact as well as suppirting local cobbler's buisness and traditions.","No","Very typical job, what pays the bills month to month because it’s fairly easy to do (with the skills and tools) and once you have the reputation in town as “the Birkenstock guy” everyone flocks to you.","TL;DR is that people complain because the shoes are expensive, they have a cult following that overpowers the negative reviews, and if you don’t like them you’re SOL."
"Source: 20yrs in kitchens and countless dollars at physical therapist over the years.","Any cobbler can resole shoes and the outsoles don't have to be from birk. Pavement gets really hot in the tropics so soles wear out very quickly, we usually opt for a more durable material than the stock EVA.","No","i wasnt sure wheather they were saying it was bread and butter because so many birks were breaking","Clearly my feelings are still hurt about how much I dont like my Birks lol"
"My podiatrist recommends them.","A good quality leather Birk can last decades if taken care of properly, just like any other leather shoe.","👎🏻","like saying they tend to break","Go ahead, I actually think you are making my point. I am a super fan, I believe I have perfect Birkenstock feet - maybe the German heritage. I have given my step daughter and now a friend of mine a pair for their birthday, got them on sale. In general, if I recommend Birkenstocks to anyone, I usually suggest to get a cheaper pair on sale somewhere. Even if the color is not perfect, you are only out $50 if you totally hate them. Otherwise it's a gateway drug. Sorry it didn't work for you, they can be marvelous"
"My super berkies last a few years. Are dish machine washable and have removable cork insoles. I wore them for most of the 20+ years I was an active chef. I wouldn’t get a leather berkie. Just get some extra insoles and a set of super berkies. They come in awesome colors as they are usually worn for gardening. But i was lame and always got black.","Yeah that is true about our pavement it does get really hot! We live at high elevation in the tropics and the pavement gets crazy hot. I didn't think of that as a factor. I care about supporting local business and the environment too. But the only place that does them here charges like 175$ for a resole which is substantially more expensive than a brand new pair, so it's just really hard to justify. I think they use a more durable vibram sole though, which I've had stock on other shoes and I do notice they don't wear out like birk soles. I've had vibram soles last years and years without any noticeable wear. So maybe it'd still be worth it to do birks to actually get a pair that is long lasting. Instead of the soles only lasting a few months.","Discussing Birks is sacred territory—and not worthy of feedback here. Ignore the off commenters. A sizable part of this group is ill equipped to even dress themselves, let alone give advice to others. I agree with my contemporaries here. Birks are, and have always been, excellent footwear. They are a staple in my family—men, women and toddlers. We’re mainly the Arizona and Bostons types. With or without socks depending on the weather. No hesitation. Take the leap and go for it! Wear like iron. Welcome to the club!","How much does all that cost? I’d assume that be getting pretty close to just buying a new pair? Or do you not typically have to do all that maybe just one? (I’ve never owned birks or been to a cobbler)","I also have never had any issues with breaking them in, and have always found them comfortable out of the box. I wish this sub would ban fit checks. You should be able to tell if a pair of shoes fit you if you are an adult."
"This is contrary to my own experience with the Super Birki—I loved them for all the same reasons, comfortable, waterproof, dishwashable. For whatever reason though, both shoes just started to split open from the ball of my foot, and only after 10 months in a pastry kitchen.","Hot pavement definitely takes a toll on soles 🙁","Do the Bostons make your feet sweet because of the closed design? Some of the clogs by Crocs used to make my feet sweat because I live in a place with extreme humidity.","It is very close to buying a new pair. I used to have a pair of Birkenstocks and when I finally wore through the cork, I discovered I'd only be saving $10-20 over buying a brand new pair, which I suppose makes sense when you consider how little material is part of the upper.","Some empathy would be nice: https://www.reddit.com/r/Birkenstocks/s/NPL5ZmfZUx"
"I have the Tokio ones now, and after 6 months have to say it’s worth the extra money so far.","Wow 175US is really expensive, it costs like 15-20US here so it's worth it. Vibram is good but more expensive than regular rubber, it will hold better than EVA for sure. None of these are meant to be used on hot pavement but what you gonna do 😅","Any type of candle with socks looks dorky and that’s a hill I’ll die on.","Yeah usually you wouldn’t have to get it all done at once LOL! More often than not it’s the sole that needs replacing when the tread wears out. Mine needed a bit of an overhaul because I got stuck outside in a tropical storm flash flood and the cork and buckles gave out (read: disintegrated) after a year or two of me pushing them to their limits post-storm.","Same. I’m tired of looking at feet pics lol"
"My first pair lasted years, but my second pair have done the same. Think I’ve traced it to the degreaser I was using on the floor.","If there is no cobbler around, you can also resole them yourself it's quite easy. The leather and cork are easy to condition at home as well. I saw your hubby's soles and that's crazy tough, does he walk on rocks a lot? Looks a bit dangerous.","Go full California grandpa and wear white socks.","I’m not entirely sure of the sorcery involved but my cobbler was able to keep the suede liner (albeit patched up in the spot by the toes that was folding over) and the straps but replace the buckles, cork and sole. It was pretty close to the cost of a new pair but I got to skip the hellish process of breaking in new ones so for me it was a win. I tried breaking in a new pair but after a year the blisters were still debilitating so I gave the cobbler a shot with the old ones. I had also gained a bunch of weight over COVID lockdowns so I have a feeling that affected my experience breaking in the new pair, because I never had that issue with the old ones.","Well, this is a birkenstock subreddit. As in a place for people with exactly the consensus that birkenstocks are right for them."
"What do you mean dishwashable ??","I wear Birks to work exclusively! I don a steady rotation of: Papillio Glenda (black), Kumba (cognac), and Ghiza (Staud collab - black). Then, dress dependant, I'll rotate in my Arizona (Festival Fuchsia), Mayari (also FF), and Ghiza (habana).","Will never not have a pair of Arizonas. Comfortable (cork bed molds to your foot, sooo good), easy to wear, look better than most sandals. I live in NC too (not Asheville) and with how hot it gets here in summer, unless I’m doing loads of walking, it’s my go to. I would agree with others that it has to fit the rest of your style. Like I wouldn’t wear khakis and a polo and Birks. Or anything dressy. But linen/cotton shorts and a camp collar or other casual shirt, you bet. Jeans or casual linen pants and a T, for sure.","After the repairs there was a mild wear-in period while the cork settled into my gait but the footbed liner and straps, were still broken in so I didn’t have any of the blistering problems I had with the new ones.","Outside that, of course they are not for everyone, it's just that everyone who don't like them probably should't join the place that mostly discusses the opposite alignment."
"Exactly that","I work in a customer-facing office - no jeans, no sneakers. I wear exclusively casual, but work appropriate, dresses. I also live in the deep south so it's sandals weather year-round. And my Birks look WAY nicer than some of the sad flats I've seen others in.","Also, I grew up in Florida so I basically lived in flip flops as a kid. Birks are the progression from that.","Wait, you can record birks? I burn through a pair every year and a half (worn year around). Where does this sorcery take place?","alright, youre kind of convincing me bostons are not for me. i had arizonas when i was younger and even then i wasnt a huge fan from my memory."
"😳","That said, I pretty much wear Birks every day. They're nice enough for work but casual enough for the weekends too. And again, sunshine year-round here I do tend to wince at the thought of a close-toed shoe!","Where what you like. People who criticize you for that are just insecure about themselves.","When I investigated the cost, it wasn’t far off from a new pair. YMMV","OP is spot on and this is true for all shoes, boots and sneakers."
"It’s a plastic clog. All waterproof. I don’t find them as comfy as the leather ones.","Ohh your collection sounds amazing","To be clear, it’s different if you ask in a public forum what people think. Have to accept there are people who won’t like them.","Yes it costs almost as much as a new pair of you have to do an overhaul. But you also don’t have to break in the leathers again which saves you some pain.","Anyone with some size 39 narrow Bostons, lemme know. 😎"
"They also make the Boston in EVA if you don't like the Super Birki and want machine washable","Everywhere I can get away with it. If the workplace requires a closed shoe, Londons at work. You can also dress those up for a date/ walk through the city. Arizonas when it’s hot out and I’m walking a lot. Kyotos mostly when I’m hanging at home. Bostons for quick errands like shopping or whatever.","Hard pass","Is there a good way to clean them? I have seen lots of Birks with footbed getting very dirty to the point of being black.","I have wide feet and got a pair of arizonas. For two'ish days they were super painful....but after that they are the most comfortable sandals I've ever worn."
"I wear the Boston's what a great show!","I also don’t live in Hawaii like you though! I’d imagine sand and water are no fun, but you’d probably get used to it in your sandals. Here in Utah, I would totally hike and camp in Arizonas. I’ve shoveled snow in my Londons and ride bikes in just about any pair.","Never understood the hate for them. They look good, age well, and are comfortable. Way better than boat shoes IMO","They’re suede so whatever you would use to clean suede. I personally never bother unless it’s rubbing off on my bare feet 🤷🏻‍♀️","Some people frown on preowned Birks, but I bought a preowned pair of Birko-flor Arizonas, and they are more comfortable than flip flops."
"Jeff don’t wear regular shoes…","Only thing I really can’t do in birks is go for a long run. What I like to do is wear my running shoes but bring sandals with me and change into those when I’m done running.","As long as you never wear them. Everything is perfect","It’s cheaper to buy a new pair than to get all of this done. They last a long time but are certainly not BIFL","While they’re not for everyone, they’re for a lot more people than most types of running sneakers. They allow for a much wider variety of foot types than a specific running shoe, which is so specific."
"I'd go for the clogs with no heel strap, once you get used to wearing them, they ain't going nowhere","Yeah I never purposely got them wet or anything but rain happens a lot here, also like wet feet after swimming, and mud when camping etc. And that volcanic mud can be thick and you need to hose them off. When the girl at the store told me they shouldn't get wet it made sense to me looking at the shoe lol. Also to keep them out of the sun. Its very very common here to leave your shoes off outside your front door.","Theyre fine if you can style them well and you dont have hideous feet","The EVA soles wear down, but are replaceable. The cork footbed can also break down, especially if you don't maintain it with cork sealer, or don't replace your EVA sole in time. The footbed is also replaceable. I wear mine pretty solidly for about half the year and need to replace my EVA sole every 2 years, and the cork footbed every 4 years or so. After about 12-15 years, the leather upper is ratty enough that I replace them.","I have flat feet and it took about 9 months to make my feet Birk Friendly. Wasa tough adjustment but now I'm fully acclimated. They are awesome. If you have flat feet and are trying to move into Birks you need to give yourself lots and lots of time. It takes us a lot longer for brake-in a new pair."
"I literally have to run up and down stairs from the prep kitchen To the line and the strap saves my ass often.","My new ones I'm gonna treat more gently i think and continue to use my old ones until they're no longer in service lol","I don't know that Birks are as breathable as what you're looking for. The cork footbed and upper covering doesn't usually breathe that well. Fwiw I swear by Uneeks: wildly comfortable, unique looking enough to look cool, and really breathable. I've also heard really good things about Bedrocks too","They can last a long time and doing the repairs is cheaper than replacing the shoes entirely, but it isn't cheap. It costs $40-$65 to replace both the sole, and $90-130 to replace both sole and footbed these days. A new pair may (depending on the model) only be $150.","I like arizona and myari. Gizeh are uncomfortable. And of course boston is good. Otherwise my go to is Dansko"
"7 days a week, 10 hours for 5 months, Boston super grips, the bottom detached. They were the best I've ever worn to be fair but too expensive to last so little time. I hope I just had a defect.","I wear them everywhere when it’s hot. I do wear mine to the beach. I live right next to the beach and go all the time.","Like the classic design. Comfortable, don’t age very well if you sweat though. Never use them in salt water.","I recently brought mine to be resoled and it cost $70, obviously cheaper than buying a new pair but I was shocked at the cost.","I like the look of Gizehs, but they are not the most comfortable Birks. The toe post is hard."
"Takes time to break them in. Uncomfortable then very comfortable after that. Check the Hooka chef shoes. EVEN WAAAAAAAY better","At home as slippers. (Shearling lined)","That look sucks, but Birks are great! Time and place for everything. I’m actually not much for putting my feet on display so I particularly like that pair better than Arizonas and they’re more seasonally appropriate than Bostons.","I bought sole material on amazon and shoe glue and redid a pair of mine. Not professional, but not really noticeable from eye height. The next pair will go smoother.","I just got my first pair of Birkenstocks (a pair of Bend Low's) this year and it's going all right so far. Breaking them in was hard, though. Multiple blisters, making me question whether I could keep them. My second pair (sandals) is getting delivered today. More blisters, I'm sure."
"I am the opposite of one poster.","Literally everywhere. Around the house (I wipe my feet really well before entering from outside), and then on errands and out and about. I got them because a nerve in my foot is inflamed and it gets very painful so I have to wear them at all times.","Yeah No","I will go against the grain and say no. They are great but i wear mine almost everyday walking my dogs and going to the beach and have to get a new pair every 3 years or so.","I can do runners, but they should be leather (Air Monarchs from Nike, for instance) because the way I walk wears holes in the area of my little toes on fabric. I wear through the soles of Converse sneakers and Toms REALLY fast. And I can't do Keen's at ALL. My little toes only come to one of the holes so they fall out all the damn time."
"The first part of wearing these is the best for me (225-245lbs very little arch in my foot)","Londons and bend low for work, Grenada and Milano for summer days off. My knees no longer hurt","I like my Birks. I’m not a big open toed shoe guy though (I have flat wide feet ugg) so when I do wear them I wear them with socks. Is it fashionable? No. Do I wear them outside my house? Only when I’m lazy. Is it comfortable? Yes.","Same. I wear mine every day and they last 2-3 years before the cork flakes away around the heel. and the soles wear through in places. I am a big person though, 6'5\" and 280lbs. Sure you could get them re-corked and re-soled, but that will cost as much as a new pair if not more.","I bought a pair of Arizona's a couple months ago and they did something to my feet that when wearing the shoes I used to wear, they were all of a sudden too tight and gave myself a treas fracture in my foot. I'm not sure if it's the Birkenstocks or what."
"After three weeks to a month it is like walking around with wood strapped to my feet.","everywhere is the answer","No.","I have also found that I prefer the \"birko-flor\" uppers to the leather ones. They shrug off water immersion whereas the leather takes a real beating, and they look good for wayyy longer. The soft fleece-like lining is also more comfortable against bare skin.","Yeah, I’m now very aware of width when trying on new closed toe shoes, I’ve even gone a size up in one particular new pair of shoes (another brand) because even a half size more than usual I could feel my sole bunched up"
"Also the soles don’t make it near a year working 50hrs a week. (I do not drag my feet)","You're lucky you only see them as kind of a hippie/deadhead concert, camping, beach shoes, an outdoorsy shoe etc. Cause I knew them as an older folks orthopedic shoes growing up and around that time hardly anyone had them unless they felt they need it for orthopedic reasons.","Horrific","They are maintain for a long life. I bought a pair in high school I wore until I was 32. And I wasn’t sealing the cork. They were serviceable enough that someone took them!","100% not for the flat footed!!"
"Got the super birkies and they are a life changer. Best you can do to your feet","Back then it wasn't as appealing, but now Birkenstock is making it more appealing. Aside from that, it can be used in most settings and places though definitely try not to get it wet, but having sand on it is completely fine. It's great now that we have choices for whatever the occasion might be, other than orthopedic use.","Bostons.. nothing else.","I’d put on one sole in that time. Should have been two, at least.","They're wonderful for this flat-foot....."
"Only ever used the Super-Birki’s - will never use anything else","Maybe it’s a regional thing? I’m 52 and bought my first pair in college 1990 in Athens GA. Aside from the random German traveler you might come across wearing them, Birkenstocks were definitely more of a hippy, widespread panic leaning shoe at that time, not an old person orthopedic shoe. They were not especially popular in the South. It’s interesting to see how common they are now. I wear mine everyday. I’m no longer working so I have the freedom to choose comfort.","My main shoe tbh, I love em. I also live in LA.","","I broke in two pairs of arizonas, one in wide shearling and one in narrow vegan, and both beat up the uppers of my feet, blisters and wounds, that healed and now both pairs are comfortable. I recently bought a pair in narrow big buckle arizonas in high shine and the uppers are razor sharp and wider, I’m afraid it will be a blood bath if I don’t return."
"Pro: what the pros wear","Yes! I love widespread! Lol the person i knew to have them was my auntie, she is about a decade older than you and was a huge deadhead. She has had a pair back as far as i can remember and in the 90s they were super popular in the hippie crowd! They're a lot more mainstream now and have of course more styles. But, i never thought they were ugly - I always thought they looked boho and pretty cool and not ugly like others say.","I work in a shoe store, one of our big selling piints is our range of birks. They're super popular at the moment and have become an all year round shoe. Obviously depends on the style you're going for, but they are really great shoes and even from a non-style point of view are absolutely worth the investment","Not the shearling ones",""
"Con: the Arbys chefs on here will swear by their crocs or new balance.","Yeah they use to cost as low as $13.95 it's amazing how far it's gotten going on 250 years.","Men shouldn't show their feet like this","I have birk shoes, two birk boots, and three birk sandals. I replace the sandals one every two years bc $60 is cheaper than new cork and sole. Boots I've paid fifty for new soles after wearing them daily from October to may for three years.",""
"/s","I've began to notice that overtime. They advertise it differently in different parts of the country or world. People wear It for many reasons. One thing for sure is, I'm glad for the ones who are able to wear it because it doesn't fit everyone.","Hard slay","I just replaced a pair after 10 years of regular wear.","I agree with most of this. Not every pair is for everybody. Sometimes some shoe styles fit great but others don't. Some styles fit better in a different width or length. And some just won't work no matter what."
"Jokes aside though, they’re not for everyone. I love em, and only used these or their other similar model for about 12 years. Make sure you get the Super-Grip version, and an insert is needed for some people to sit on top of the cork for some people","","Hating on sandals is such a cringe millennial take","I also strongly believe they are functionally better if worn with socks. They just get kinda slimy and gross if you get even a little bit of moisture on the footbed.","I like this sub because it's a great place to ask questions about birks from folks who have been wearing them for years. I find the \"one size fits all\" advice/responses to questions from some folks to be a bit tiring, tho'. Even if the question isn't about fit, their go to is to ask you if your straps are too tight. As someone else noted, we're adults and know if shoes fit or not."
"Edit, I got sick of getting wet feet during scrub down at the end of the night from the hot soapy water on the floor, so I switched to these for a while, slightly better for water proofing https://www.acechefapparels.com.au/products/linz-smooth-leather-in-black-classic-footbed-supergrip-sole?variant=2793056305173&currency=AUD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_term=15435117296&utm_adgroup=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwsPCyBhD4ARIsAPaaRf2gafDNn19FcEs4Qkd8iiuzFRJ_sUpt3qqdnYUMLhnSRNs7pioPEY4aAgx-EALw_wcB","","Technically I’m a Millennial and she’s Gen Z so idk","The professional clogs (super burki)are not repairable. You can replace the insole as it just slips in but depending on how much is spilled on the shoes if you are working with a lot of grease. You could get the boston super grip or tokio super grip, which are repairable, but more effort is gonna be needed to keep the cork sealed.","For me, I know that I have to break in/adjust to most shoes because I have weird feet. Even my beloved Brooks Ghosts. So breaking in a pair of birks is expected."
"They absolutely suck to break in, but they are amazing after that. You need to take care of them and clean them very often, or the leather will disintegrate . The price is also steep but are worth it. I wore the Tokio super grips for years and loved them, but I am back to crocs now. Easier, cheaper, tougher but less comfortable.","Everywhere everyday","I don’t care what the haters say, they are fly as fuck bro.

I can immediately see why you would suggest Huaraches as a fashionable sandal. They’re giving me a very Latin vibe though, and I’m not sure I can pull them off as a very pan blanco dude. I’m going to keep looking into them though. They’ve very nice.","You technically can replace parts of the shoes as mentioned by others but honestly it’s more expensive to repair than to get new ones.","Especially when you yourself had needed confirmation on how your first pair of Birks fit. Not even all that long ago."
"Those soles suck. They are not as thick as standard Birkenstock. They barely lasted me a year, and I wear multiple shoes throughout the week. They are really hard with no actual cushion. If you try to resole they grease from kitchens make it impossible for the next sole to stick. I had a pair around 2019-2020 and now I just wear regular pair of bostons. I have been wearing the same pair since then and the sole is still fine, and more comfortable. Also you can get soft bed insoles for the regular style ones. Black or brown oiled leather, soft bed. Much better","Surgery resident here. I wear my oiled Havana Londons nearly everyday I operate. I have a pair of bostons that occasionally make an appearance. I’ve work those with professional wear as well.","As long as you NEVER wear them with socks they're perfectly ok to wear at home.","With that said, mine have lasted over 8 years of wearing them a few times a week. I recently bought new ones that look nicer, but I still plan to wear the old ones around the house and stuff","I do value the information and advice I’ve received on this sub, both for me directly and for others. But, I have seen this stock advice I mentioned from a number of people, including newbies, and sometimes it’s not helpful or it doesn’t answer the question. If someone asks a specific question about one thing, the automatic response shouldn’t be that the posters straps are too tight or they’re the wrong size."
"I only wear birkenstocks in the kitchen. Like several others have said, breaking them in can be rough. But after that, they are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn for 12 + hour days. I own both the super birkis and the boston clogs. I rotate days, but the Boston are my favorite for sure.","I have Birkenstocks for every season. Boots for winter, Bostons for early spring and early fall, and then open toe ones for the rest of the time. My house slippers are also Birkenstocks. For me, it’s a lifestyle. They’re so comfortable… I never get sick of wearing them, which is literally every where.","Ha! You had me with the first part. I do plan to wear them out to casual places like breweries, grocery stores, etc. Do you have any alternative suggestions?","Nope, the Birks kitchen clogs can crack and then then start to split and eventually fall apart, or at the very least are no longer waterproof, I had much better luck with the Croc Bistros","I’m sorry you took my comment personally but it doesn’t change anything I’ve said. Both can be true."

"Lots of people talking about the price. In the UK you can get a pair of Bostons for around £70 ($90 give or take), now I'm happy to pay that for trains/sneakers/vans/converse that I wear a lot more casually.  Now compare that to how much I pay for the Birks and how much I wear them, I'm in them easily 200-240 hours a month depending on the time of year....

But they’re definitely worth the price point and last a really long time.",""
"Pro: comfortable Con: hot splashes and spills with open back shoes.","I'm not allowed to be barefoot or wear flip flops again per podiatrist orders, so I'm always in them once it gets warm. I have a pair of fake leather Gizahs that probably get the most wear and two Francas that get a moderate amount.","Thoughts? My thoughts goes towards dreadlocked pubic hairs.","Not all models can have the footbed replaced. Classic footbeds can 100% be replaced. The cost depends on where you have it done.",""
"I would get something that offers more protection, personally.","I wear them pretty much everywhere except the gym. I have a fuzzy pair that I use as slippers, hospitality ones for work, and two other pairs that I use for errands / wearing out wherever!","I shave tho?","I get about 5 summers out of mine. Not worth repairing, just re-buy",""
"My bottom sole cracked badly and tossed them, didn't look repairable. Didn't get the life out of them I expected.","I wear mine almost exclusively for every activity including mild landscaping projects. I have 2 pair, idk the names but they're the women's style with the crossed toe, 1 pair is for nice outfits and the other is for garden clothes.","Ok, you get a pass.","I can destroy a pair of birks in a few months, but I walk a lot. I justified he last pair I bought saying I could have them repaired, but the leather stretched out of shape, the sole wore through quickly and the cork cracked and crumbled even though I applied cork sealant regularly. No part was worth saving after a summer of living in them. They were comfy though.",""
"Never had then but I would say 1 con is that they don’t cover your whole foot so your socks can get wet when scrubbing the floors I’ve also seen people just walk out of the second one by accident","I almost exclusively wear my birks. I have non-birk sneakers for walking or biking, but otherwise, I'm in birk sandals all day every day. I had a couple of pairs with a back strap when I worked in an office (to meet dress code requirements), but I prefer the identical back sandals. I live in a warm climate, so don't really need closed tow shoes.","Cool vibe","Mine tend to fall apart and need replacement every 2-3 seasons, but I also wear them constantly and probably could be better maintained. Still, they’re my favourite footwear and worth the replacement for me.",""
"I wore Boston’s for years and they helped fuck up my back? How you ask. I stand with my weight on my heels so the cork sunk in.","Everyday everywhere for everything. I even have the non-slip ones for work. I'll die in my Birks","No thanks","They are of high quality, the soft soled ones less so, get the original.",""
"Go try and stand with your heels lower than your toes. Your body mechanics are all jacked and your hips push out wrong and you generally don’t stand shoulders over hips over toes.","Everywhere. Sandals in the hot months (it’s Texas, there’s a lot of those), Boston or Zurich whenever I want to, Oswego when I want sneakers, Callan or Gary to work, though the Stalon has been worn a lot more the last few years.

Check all his Birkenstock breakdowns.",""
"My doc told me I needed to switch to something with orthopedic heels. It just means the heels are elevated a bit. Why do you think every nurse wears clogs? And a lot of chefs.","literally any and everywhere!! I looove my birks.","I wear them when no one is looking.....I never said that.","Then decide.",""
"I was told once you can have happy feet or a happy back and legs but not both. I actually grew to love my clogs. They’re old school but serve a purpose.","I wear EVAs arizonas around the house, Florida when I want to wear socks, gizeh for travel and dresses, granada for checking the mail, and Milano when I want my foot to feel secure during every day wear.","Don’t worry I never heard you say it either.","Some Birks are fine, others.....",""

"Man, I've never worn any of these types of shoes in a kitchen. I used to always replace my light weight Bates boots. Non slip and easy to maneuver when you need to sprint to the back to grab something when you're in the weeds.","I wear mine everywhere, with everything from leggings to shorts, jeans, dresses. Basically like I’d wear sneakers.","these are for women above the age of 50","As a German, I had them since Kindergarten. Usually, you wear them one warm period and buy new ones for the next warm period.",""
"Liked wearing these but always found they gave me major painful cracked heals because they are more exposed on the back. Wearing trainers in the kitchen now, not had a problem since","Every day at the office","I’ve read that they’re not comfortable if you have flat feet. I’m ordering a $30 dupe off Amazon because of that to try.","If you have a pair for inside, you can keep them longer but otherwise they are gross after some months.",""
"None. I have both and speed walk and drive with them","I echo the other answers of Anywhere and Everywhere. I've lived exclusively in warm weather west/southwest US my whole life and there isn't anywhere I wouldn't be comfortable in birks. I have multiple pairs and some stay nicer and others are kick around the yard, garden, Saturday afternoons etc. without care or concern. Unlined Bostons are perfect for my current climate winter weather, so would estimate that I wear some kind of Birkenstock over 300 days per year.","I have flat feet. They’re actually good for you if you do. It hurt at first, but after a couple of days I got used to them and now they’re super comfortable.","I would not say they are BIFL, but they are extremely comfortable once broken in. I’d say you get a solid two years of use, but the soles wear down rather quick. Have not had mine resoled, but definitely a good feature and why I bought my first. I’m on my second pair, but wore first pair down beyond repair. Comfy as hell, but not great in wet climates, as this apparently degrades them quicker. Also very slippery on wet surfaces once sole wears down. Here is a link an article with some tips on keeping them going for longer.",""
"They take a little breaking in and they are great for walking long distances but, standing all day these things are the best.","I think the younger generation is getting into Birks for their recent rise in popularity, hence the reason we see so many posts about minor flaws in the leather, scuffs to suede, legit checks, fit checks, etc.","","https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/guides/how-to-clean-birkenstocks/",""
"Pro tip: slather Shoe Goo on the thickness of the cork edge at the heel. It'll protect the cork and will add longevity. Repeat every so often, as needed.","I buy exclusively from the birkenstock website, so didn't realize that fake Birks had become a thing to worry about!","","They’re quality, but no, not BIFL.",""
"And, as others have said, when they finally do start to really wear out, take them to a cobbler. They can probably be fixed up for cheaper than a new pair.","They were my go to college shoes. Wore my Arizonas in Arizona until the rubber wore away to the cork. It wasn’t worth it to re-sole them because they were the synthetic uppers and they were starting to tear so I replaced them with some suede ones that are still going strong.","","Absolutely not. A pair of birks lasts me a year, two at most. I walk a lot, but still buy them because they’re supportive and comfortable. If you’re a chef, get the super birkis, they were designed for kitchen use. You can hose them down and replace the inner insert as needed. No cork sole to wear away. They should last a few years.",""
"Edit: for clarity. No Goo on the foot bed, of course. That would be icky.","We live on a ranch so we need to take our shoes off upon entering. I have three pairs. Beaters for chores outback, A mid pair for grocery runs, and a nice pair I call my Sunday go-to meet'n shoes.","","They last a little over a year. If you have a place locally that can record/resole them then it's worth it to have that done as it's like $50 less than a new pair",""
"I had a pair of these a couple years ago and while very comfortable they didn't last me very long. I wore them for maybe six months in a winery kitchen and then switched to a hospital - I worked there part time for about a year and a half and by the time I threw them away the sole was completely worn through.","At home, around the block, in town, on the beach... Basically everywhere unless I'm riding the bike long distance or walking the dogs.","","No, they won’t last forever. There are steps you can take to make them last longer but ultimately they dissolve. End clothing has them on sale from time to time and can be cheap these days. The quality and price point is great if you have wide feet.",""
"For a $200 shoe I was hoping for something a bit more durable.","I wear my wool felts to pick up my kid from school because it's cold as heck","","FWIW I used to go into operating rooms a lot and you'd be surprised at the number of Crocs I'd see in the change rooms after hours.",""
"Wear out too fast. Get mephistos.","I wear birkenstocks every single day of the year. Dressy or casual. Doesn't matter.","","They will last 10-15 years depending on how much you walk in them.",""
"I use Boston super grip. This is my second pair. I will never go back to Walmart shoes lol. Pros: easy to get on, excellent grip, firm but soft soles. After about 2+ years of wear you’ll need some insoles, but as long as the material is still holding out, they’ll do their job excellently. Cons: breaking them in is a bitch. If you have the back strap expect blisters at first.","My go to shoe. Prevents painful plantar fasciitis for me, so I wear them 100% of the time at home, and all summer.

"Steve Madden steel toe, don’t wear sandals to work…","","","I need a new pair about once every five years. They can be resoled, but the cork starts wearing down and breaking up. I work from home and wear them all day everyday around the house, so they might last a lot longer for others.",""
"Pros: super comfy once you get used to the flatness of them.\nCons: can be tough if you're spending long hours in kitchens without mats. I switched to something with more heel support and was much happier. Also, I wasn't great about wiping them off at the end of shifts, and the stitching literally rotted through on a few pairs. I never got more than 9 months or a year at most out of them.","","","I’m heartbroken that a cobbler to whom I sent my 22-year-old Birkenstock Bostons lost them 😢 Aside from that, they are definitely buy it for life!",""

The og styles can be bifl with proper care and maintenance. Resole before you walk through the sole. Treat the leather and the cork. The newer styles that look like regular shoes, not so much.",""
"They're uncomfortable for about a week or so because it takes time for them to mould to your feet but once you do they're really comfortable, they just don't last as long in a busy kitchen as they used to do they're build quality is lower than they used to be but still comfortable","","","I hope not",""
