"the “BIFL” aspect of Birks is that you can go to nearly any cobbler and have them resoled, or send to Birks and get fresh cork or leather. the cork will eventually deteriorate, but i’ve gotten a decade out of mine and only then was the cork showing its age.","I wear some form of Birks every damn day. I have four pairs of their sandals and a pair of their insoles in the three pairs of Docs I rotate for work.

"i feel like there is a bit too much desire for products to last “for life,” when repairability is just as important imo. pretty much every product will wear out with time and use. if you can replace parts and keep the majority of it in service, that’s a win in my book.","I am a fan, they fit my wide feet well and have a certain geeky Euro-chic look I can live with. I have the fleece-lined Boston clogs as my house shoes. I have the Bend Low sneaker in black, and the Stalon Chelsea boots.

"Agreed mine last maybe two years then are not fixable…cork crumbing, soles totally wore down.

"It depends on the ones you purchase. Birkenstock still sells its original solid cork soled and leather sandals. I have two pairs of those and a pair of clogs made from the same materials. Two pairs are barely broken in after 5 years of use and the other pair is almost 10 years old and still in great shape. However, they now offer a soft cork sole, fake leather, and rubber/foam shoes. I'm very skeptical that those last as long as the original Birkenstock designs. If you're looking at a pair that costs $70, I'm guessing it's made from the newer and cheaper materials.","My coworker prefers Brooks. She has smaller feet too. Don’t know if there’s a connection.","My coworker prefers Brooks. She has smaller feet too. Don’t know if there’s a connection."
"Also, Birkenstocks take some upkeep if you want them to last. I reseal the cork almost yearly, which is part of why they've lasted so long.","I love my Birkenstock sandals and have had several pairs over the past many many years. However, the Boston clog… I’ve tried and as a fellow Canadian, I have to say I’d have no idea what the right weather is for these shoes. You can’t wear them if it’s wet or snowy, they don’t make sense in the summer… And then, in addition, you can’t wear them if you’re walking anywhere where there’s loose dirt or gravel or trail mulch because it will just flip right into the back of the shoe. There’s like a one week window in my area of the world where the weather is just right for these - it just doesn’t seem worth it to me when they’re basically only good as house shoes, and I already have Glerups for that. I donated mine.","I love my Birkenstock sandals and have had several pairs over the past many many years.

"100% this. Cork ones are still ok with upkeep, but the newer rubber/foam ones don’t even last my kid a year.","I wear mine for that one glorious week of perfect fall weather, and then much to my husband's horror I wear them throughout the winter as slip-on shoes when I'm just driving around to run errands. They 1000% will get wet and your feet will be too cold, but i get boots fatigue wearing my big Sorels all winter long, so i like having a slip-on option for my lazy days.

"Yeah I bought a pair of the rubber ones and they lasted me 2 years with pretty heavy use in the summer. They’re good but not BIFL","If you can find them - I have women’s Chelsea Sorels that look like their Men’s Hi-Line Chelsea. They’re cloud soft on the bottom, waterproof and pull on.

"Baking soda and water, scrub, followed by vinegar soak. The baking soda takes out the grime but it's a base so it's slippery, vinegar neutralizes. I do it every 6 months or so.

"There's shoes that can be resoled and the upper refinished. You can get more than 500 miles out of them. BIFL isn't just extreme durability. Repairability counts too.","I do not like Birkenstocks, unfortunately. The soles of those suck every bit of moisture from my feet and make my heels crack. 😬","I do not like Birkenstocks, unfortunately.

"I have a pair that I bought 3 years ago that I have worn pretty much every day/all day for 3 summers in a row. Just yesterday one of the straps separated from the sole of the shoe, there’s also some separating of the inside lining and the cork and the rubber sole is worn down from regular wear. However, I still consider them BIFL, because there are plenty of cobblers that will resole and do other repairs to birks. I’m dropping mine off today to have them repaired!","",""
"My Arizona model birkies lasted about 10 years of heavy wear with zero maintenance. The heel wore down a bit too much. I was going to keep them as slipper types but chucked them (I didn’t know that repair was an option) and replaced with an identical pair and they are going strong 5+ years in.","",""

"Yes and no. Big plus that they can be repaired so much and last a long time. But depending on wear you might need to resole them every year, and the cork will probably need repair at some point as it crumbles and degrades. The repair costs do add up.","",""

"Not BIFL. I had arizonas and another type, both leather with the traditional footbed, and for each pair, after 2 years of wear I had plantar fasciitis flare ups because they wore so badly. Now, I wore each pair very frequently indoors and out, but still. To me that makes them not BIFL.","",""
