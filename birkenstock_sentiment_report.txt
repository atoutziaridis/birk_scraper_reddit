      - i have hardwood floors and theyre the only thing that prevents plantar fasciitis for me i wear them constantly when im home and im not a particularly small dude so i tend to crush down the heels a little especially if they get a bit wet i dont know about for life but i dont mind replacing them every years thats highly subjective to be honest hi ububblymetal they really are stunning in au they are which is a bit rich for me but i will covet them regardless i kinda love these because theyre so ugly the material of the straps is fine the footbed material is the reason i wont buy another pair of vegan i have sweaty feet and these make my feet absolutely stink i have basically no problem in regular suede footbed birkenstocks but the vegan and i just do not get along i have the bend low and like them a lot wow these look way better in your photos than the official ones looks good the break in period is tough on these but once broken they are a breeze to wear however the birk sneakers dont have the best reviews on the net so i would say its a good model especially for the climate while i live in north america i spent some time in southeast asia backpacking and used my mayaris and kairo models while there was some occasional dustdirt id just take a mildly damp cloth and wipe them down each day they held up remarkably well the birkoflor is synthetic but i find easier to break in the leather will last longer i have them but i wouldnt recommend they took forever to break in and get dirty very easy despite suede protection im really glad that this spring has so many new designs or revisiting older ones i dont recall having so much new in recent seasonal releases the honnef is one of the most comfortable shoes ive ever worn i do work somewhere where i get a pretty hefty discount though dont really see myself dropping on them i also own the high top bends which has the same sole and footbed as the oswego also very comfy yes what is up with that not even a review on zappos great price i looked at them and would buy them but i have an issue with buckles i posed them months ago here and they got little love but i usually dont agree with the majority here so i say buy them long long time ago i bought a pair of brooks athletic shoes for and they didnt last but a month it was a lot of money back then and i was really ticked off lol
      - you might want to consider oofos for house wear i love mine and they really feel good on the pf i personally live in birks have done for years so yeah i think its worth it this is a reminder to ensure that your recent submission in rindianfashionaddicts follows all of our rules which are visible in the sidebar if it doesnt your submission may be removed attention commenters read and follow the new rules in the sidebar before commenting oof theyre actually slightly cheaper compared to where im at singapore i paid the equivalent of aud they look like birkenstock from year i have flat feet too my first pair of bostons were vegan and i could not break them in fully no matter what i did i ended up consigning them after several months of wear are they true to your regular shoe size sending my curriculum to birkenstock now ive been very happy with my bends i have pairs low white low black hightop white the design is simple and they coordinate with most of my wardrobe the breakin period has been the same as my arizonas i agree with the previous poster about keeping the leather white which is why i have pairs of the low white the older dirtier ones for walking and everyday activities the newer brighter ones for work church etc ive seen the negative reviews online but ive had all good luck with mine try them mayari is perfect for hot and humid tropical climates sometimes they get in the rain and puddles but thats life i clean mine with baking soda without water just sprinkle dry leave overnight and dust off the next day you can even try rubbing baking soda dry on certain areas i have the bend low in midnight still breaking it in but love it so far someone else said it best in another thread its like kyoto and arizona had a whirlwind love affair and thus the uji was born i would love to know how you get a discount it seems impossible to find anywhere you are actually able to do you have to do it in person basically thanks have you found any reviews edit to say you and i seem to have similar taste and sources of good deals so not sure if im the best to advise you yavery few companies that actually work for me so i am pissed when they try to pull a fast one the glue separating itself could be me id not blame birk for that but its the fakery as if the whole midsole is made of cork but it is not
      - just googled and there are a couple places near me that sell them will check them out thanks for the intel same here i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns wheres a good place in sg to buy birks im on the fence with these dont get me wrong they look great on you i just cant figure out the use scenario with a waterresistant grippy sole but a rather delicate suede upper are they heavy do they make your feet warm i hate the material always gives blisters no matter how much i break them in i stick to leather now yes they fit the same as my arizona and boston mind dropping the pants brand ive got these pretty happy with them probably would buy them again once ive worn them out i dont find them mega comfortable for lots of walking but tbh if i was walking a lot like all day id probably reach for proper trainers instead of shoes like this of any brand i dont walk far in any birkenstocks i own i have very sweaty feet you wont believe it there is no smell in my birks i have them in a dark red i like them theyre good quality but i dont love them since they do not have the toe bar its a different footbed more smooth inside i like it but not sur if ill try because it might look a little too clunky on me i worked at a birkenstock store the best discounts that im aware of outside of that are in the last chance section on the official birkenstock website did you find any reviews or end up getting them ive been thinking about buying them too in which occassion would you wear these yes thats some bullsht i watched that video a couple weeks ago and it was certainly disheartening
   Negative Comments:
      - and by the way you can quite literally make any car last for infinity if you replace every part when it breaks including even an engine swap i love this color way honestly they arent the prettiest shoe but they are so cool to me they look so sick ive been thinking about getting them but the price seemed a bit high also with plastic hooks instead of metal leaning towards not getting them now double check this my londons have no toebar
      - the ones that you hear about from years ago were made years ago now the cork just explodes if you so much as walk in grass sole deforms buckles rust and ive had mine fixed and resoled within months and still all these problems this is rd pair st fell apart less than weeks daily summer use and replaced under warranty then left out to get moldy on a farm rd pair about fucked with multiple trips to the cobbler oh yeah leather buckled and cracked new sole separating glue exploding i didnt say six months even once go away impulse bought this as im looking for a nice pair of work shoes do you think this will hold up well i didnt know i liked these gotta get em i wanted london i want it but its summer now so i cant do it
      - it seems like they no longer make them to last forever i just looked and many are fake leather the souls of the shoes are different too im not sure but im hard on shoes and my last pare lasted only a year but i wore them everyday in mud rain dirt and heat around in summer months im supper hard on shoes i torture shoes my tivas lasted longer till a neighbor dog ate them but were so not as comfortable now that i quit smoking and have a few years on me i might try them again i did wear them daily so if you are going to spend the money try on at least six pairs in a shoe store for example lets say you think you wear a regular you should try on regular regular regular narrow narrow narrow pay attention to where your toes hit the footbed in front where the toe bar hits and how your heel moves in the cup thank you the model name of the solid black ones is profibirkis same size as arizona
