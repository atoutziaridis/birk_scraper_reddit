"I have hardwood floors and they’re the only thing that prevents plantar fasciitis for me. I wear them constantly when I’m home and I’m not a particularly small dude so I tend to crush down the heels a little, especially if they get a bit wet. I don’t know about for life, but I don’t mind replacing them every 2-3 years","That’s highly subjective, to be honest.","Hi, u/Bubbly-Metal5829!","They really are stunning. In AU they are $392 which is a bit rich for me, but I will covet them regardless!","I kinda love these because they’re so ugly.","The material of the straps is fine. The footbed material is the reason I won’t buy another pair of vegan. I have sweaty feet and these make my feet absolutely stink. I have basically no problem in regular suede footbed Birkenstocks but the vegan and I just do not get along.","I have the bend low and like them a lot","Wow, these look way better in your photos than the official ones. Looks good!","The break in period is tough on these but once broken they are a breeze to wear. However the birk sneakers don’t have the best reviews on the net.","So I would say it’s a good model especially for the climate. While I live in North America, I spent some time in Southeast Asia backpacking and used my mayari’s and Kairo models. While there was some occasional dust/dirt, I’d just take a mildly damp cloth and wipe them down each day. They held up remarkably well. The birko-flor is synthetic but I find easier to break in. The leather will last longer.","I have them but I wouldn’t recommend. They took forever to break in and get dirty very easy despite suede protection.","I'm really glad that this spring has so many NEW designs, or revisiting older ones. I don't recall having so much 'new' in recent seasonal releases.","The Honnef is one of THE most comfortable shoes I’ve ever worn. I do work somewhere where I get a pretty hefty discount though. Don’t really see myself dropping $200 on them. I also own the high top Bends which has the same sole and footbed as the Oswego. Also VERY comfy.","Yes, what is up with that, not even a review on Zappo’s.","Great price! I looked at them and would buy them but I have an issue with buckles. I posed them months ago here and they got little love, but I usually don't agree with the majority here so I say buy them!","Long long time ago, I bought a pair of Brooks athletic shoes for $40+, and they didn’t last but a month… it was a lot of money back then and I was really ticked off lol."
"You might want to consider Oofos for house wear. I LOVE mine and they really feel good on the PF.","I personally live in birks, have done for years.

They’re actually slightly cheaper compared to where I’m at - Singapore. I paid the equivalent of $426 AUD.","They look like birkenstock from year 2356","I have flat feet too. My first pair of Bostons were vegan and I could not break them in fully, no matter what I did. I ended up consigning them after several months of wear.","Are they true to your regular shoe size?","Sending my curriculum to Birkenstock now 😂","I've been very happy with my Bends. I have 4 pairs (2 low white, 1 low black, 1 hightop white). The design is simple and they coordinate with most of my wardrobe. The break-in period has been the same as my Arizona's. I agree with the previous poster about keeping the leather white, which is why I have 2 pairs of the low white (the older, dirtier ones for walking and everyday activities; the newer, brighter ones for work, church, etc). I've seen the negative reviews online, but I've had all good luck with mine. Try them!!","Mayari is perfect for hot and humid tropical climates; sometimes they get in the rain and puddles but that’s life. I clean mine with baking soda (without water!). Just sprinkle dry, leave overnight, and dust off the next day. You can even try rubbing baking soda dry on certain areas.","I have the Bend Low in Midnight. Still breaking it in but love it so far.","Someone else said it best in another thread, it’s like Kyoto and Arizona had a whirlwind love affair and thus the Uji was born.","I would love to know how you get a discount, it seems impossible to find anywhere you are actually able to. Do you have to do it in person basically? Thanks!","Have you found any reviews?","edit to say you and I seem to have similar taste and sources of good deals, so not sure if I'm the best to advise you :)","Ya...very few companies that actually work for me so i am pissed when they try to pull a fast one. The glue separating itself could be me I'd not blame Birk for that but it's the fakery as if the whole midsole is made of cork but it is not."
"Just googled and there are a couple places near me that sell them. Will check them out.. thanks for the intel.","Same here","I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.","Where’s a good place in SG to buy Birks?","I'm on the fence with these. Don't get me wrong, they look great on you! I just can't figure out the use scenario with a water-resistant, grippy sole but a rather delicate suede upper. Are they heavy? Do they make your feet warm?","I hate the material. Always gives blisters no matter how much I break them in. I stick to leather now.","Yes they fit the same as my arizona and Boston","Mind dropping the pants brand?","I’ve got these. Pretty happy with them. Probably would buy them again once I’ve worn them out. I don’t find them mega comfortable for lots of walking but tbh if I was walking a lot like all day, I’d probably reach for proper trainers instead of shoes like this of any brand. I don’t walk far in any Birkenstocks I own","I have very sweaty feet. You won't believe it . There is no smell in my birks","I have them in a dark red. I like them. They’re good quality. But i don’t love them since they do not have the toe bar. It’s a different footbed, more smooth inside.","I like it but not sur if I'll try because it might look a little too clunky on me","I worked at a Birkenstock store. The best discounts, that I’m aware of outside of that, are in the “last chance” section on the official Birkenstock website.","Did you find any reviews or end up getting them? I've been thinking about buying them too","In which occassion would you wear these?","Yes! That’s some bullsht! I watched that video a couple weeks ago and it was certainly disheartening"
"This comment made me feel so validated. I thought I was imagining my feet feeling better after wearing them inside all weekend.","Considering a pair can last you 15 years or more with care, id say yes. Also considering inflation, id say yes. I got my Bostons for like $69 I think 8 years ago. If I had known what was gonna happen to prices I would’ve gotten 3 or 4 more pairs of other styles.","They’re not comfortable at all. But they’re good for you. There’s a difference.","Try for size in store, then order on the U.S. site and use a forwarder to ship to SG","They’re noy heavy per se, but the are havier than other clogs. Yes they keep my feet warm","Yeah I agree, it doesn't feel good to wear!","do they have the same size footbeds?","Sure, they are dundup","Bends are comfortable. The rubber soles don’t last very long though. Mine lasted about 6 months before there were holes that would allow water to soak my socks if it was slightly wet outside.","I use a pair of Arizonas in India and haven’t had any issues. Wiping the birkins once a week with a wet cloth has helped and they don’t seem to pick up the sweat stink.","I’m the opposite. I can’t stand the toe bar but I love my Oswegos which also don’t have the toe bar. Maybe I would like the Bend. There isn’t really cork in the Bend though, right?","I ordered a black pair from Germany. Will post a pic when they arrive.","Thanks!","No. I don’t need them yet, and still no reviews I can find.","Well for me it's in place of I think my trail shoes if I'm not really being athletic, and it's raining. So when I would wear my Kay, but in the rain.","This is really interesting channel thanks"
"I find the cork cracks very quickly even if I use that special coating.","One thing I’d suggest is not to waste any money on synthetic materials or fad styles, like the faux fir or goofy colors. Get something that will be durable and look classic for years, like an oiled leather Arizona.","Not comfortable 🥲 i rather walk on lego 💀","Dropped you a PM","They vaguely remind me of Midoriya Izuku’s shoes from My Hero Academia, his upgraded shoes with the steel toe.","","As far as I can tell yes.","Based ty sir.","not worth the money. I also have wide feet. get a pair of new balances.","","🤨ME: Googling 'toebar'... 😆","One of the reasons I went for it is because RA affects my feet and I thought the ability to make minor fit adjustments might be good for bad days. And I really like my Kyotos but wont want to wear them when it’s 100 degrees outside. But we shall see.","What do you think of the Oswego? I was considering those !","I got some. I'll let you know","Would totally wear them out casually as well (shopping, non-business apts etc.). Couldn't justify the price without having tried/feeling them in hand. I like the mix of futuristic and old school look. At the same time I guess not as repairable as other Birkenstocks, which is a bummer. For 84€ I'd snag them :D","If you watch that whole video, which I did last month and again just now, you’ll see that after he cuts those 3 pairs open, only one of them (the black work shoe) is BS. The others have a full bed of cork in them and he gives them the non-BS OK. The channels are in there for comfort. The last 2 shoes in that video have channels in them as well. Above or below, depending on the model there is a full layer of cork. If you look at your Callan, beneath those vanilla channels is a bed of cork. Anvil goes into depth that those channels can break, although he admits it is rare, and that he would put a full layer without the channels, but says the reason they are doing this is for comfort. A full cork bed takes a good bit of time to break in, and likely they would get many returns when people don’t feel comfortable within a few days or weeks…as it usually takes even longer than that to break them in. That’s why they came out with a whole line of SOFT Footbeds in their most popular Arizona’s, as people’s chief complaint was they didn’t want to take the time to break them in and they weren’t comfortable. They had to appeal to those people. I just got the Callans and they feel amazing. You say after “like” a year, was that one year or a like a year and a half? Yours look like they are worn pretty hard. I have suede Birks that I’ve owned for 4 years that look almost like new, nothing like yours. I rotate mine. Honestly yours look they were worn pretty regularly. They don’t look horrible for being that old. Unless you’re getting boots, everyday shoes do not last that long. Running shoes are to be replaced after you’ve run so many miles on them. I have friends who buy $250 Nikes, $200 NB’s etc…and replace them every four months because the cushioning wears out after they hit a certain mileage mark. Maybe you pulled them off gently, maybe you pulled them off hard? But a year or more of regular wear, I do think that it’s possible they come apart where they did if you weren’t careful with them. Maybe you were very careful and it still happened, I don’t know.? Only you know honestly about that. You should be able to take these to a cobbler and get that sewn up. People who have one pair of Birks and wear them everyday need to spend like $50-$70 every year and a half to get them resoled. I don’t think you are completely off though with some of your thoughts. There are boots they make that are pretty much a sham. Only the Birmingham model is up to Anvil’s standards after cutting them in half. That is disappointing. And on the Callan I see the elastic on the sides that stretch so you can get your foot in wears out on a lot of used ones I see for sale, and yours as well. I find that disappointing. I’ve taken note that is a weak spot and will be more careful how I angle my foot in there versus just blasting them on. But there is cork below those channels on them so I don’t think you can complain about there not being cork, it’s just like 75% with channels vs 100%. When I was young if I wanted a pair of Nikes, it was drilled into me to take care of them because I wasn’t going to get another pair for a very long time. So I guess I was trained to take excellent care of everything I got to the utmost level to make things last as “money wasn’t grown on trees” in my 5 member family…my parents words. Lastly I will add that I have 47 pair of Birks and I have NEVER paid full price. I just got the exact same Callan’s you have as a Birkenstock member for $74 shipped. They are on sale for $77 and members get an extra 10% off. Just need to sign up online as a member for free. And I just scored a pair of Taupe Callan’s for $75 on eBay that are 99% new. I got two pair of Birmingham Boots for a ridiculous price of $85 each shipped on eBay, 100% legit with box and all….retail is $350 each. Yes they make ripoffs that are easily debunked in Arizona’s, but the other models are very rare to copy. I got 3 pair of Bend’s on Poshmark for an average of $60 shipped this spring/summer. I get Arizona’s and Kyoto’s on eBay and Posh for an average of $70. So at that price it is completely worth it. I would never pay full price when there are always tons of deals around that are completely legitimate. I’d say 5 pair I bought were worn once or twice, the rest were never touched, brand new with box and all. I’ve also gotten some Vegan Birks from Matchesfashion in the UK and another UK site shipped cheap for $70’ish. My point is there are places to score them for less than half price if a person takes a little time to search. I’ve been collecting for 4 years now and have saved at least $6K. If I can do it anyone can. Birkenstocks while not 100% perfect across the board, are by far and away the best thing that ever happened to my feet. I can no longer wear any other shoe or sneaker after 4 years. I wear them nonstop around the house and whenever I go out. As soon as I put on some of my other high end boots and sneakers, both of my feet are sore the next day for hours when I wake up. Anyway, that’s my view. You may still disagree and that is ok."
"I really love mine. I'm not sure if I'd call them bifl, but they are for some people. Mine need to be recorked or replaced. To fix the soles costs about as much as a new pair in my area. The cobbler actually thought I'd go for this...","Old post but can they really last long like that? I feel like they're not long lasting at all. The grip/bottoms wear down to nothing very quickly. And the cork footbed break down and deteriorate easily. I have noticed the straps last long.","I thought crocs were like that. Thanks for sharing. Can you recommend some comfortable sandal or flip flops.","Ouchies! Honestly, if someone loves them it isn't the end of the world to drop $400 on a decent pair of shoes. I just bought Boston clogs for about $220 which just feels a bit more budget friendly :P","They look like climbing shoes.","","I bought a pair of a while ago but was very disappointed and sent them back. The reason I wear the sandals is they are foot shaped and they allow my toes to spread out properly, the shoes that I bought were nothing like the sandals, much narrower and they hurt my feet 😭","The website photos are so bad. The models foot is like 2 sizes too small and narrow for them","for more info on why Birkenstock sneakers aren't worth it, look up rose anvil on YouTube. look for their video on Birkenstock sneakers.","","Haha you might! It’s a Similar footbed between Bend and Oswego","I can relate. The only shoe I can wear at this point is Birkenstock, and even then only certain models. I love the Kyoto for me since they are like a hug on my feet, and for being adjustable.","Interesting, I’ve been super happy with the shoes I got for work (office job), the Callan and the Gary. I have the Harris and Bryson too but those are boots. This does make me want an Oswego even more.","My hero!!","Ok I bought them","I see your point but i did pay full price on this when they first came out. The Arizonas are good yes. At the price, this is cheap construction. At 75, they are ok. I don't beileive i saw any cork under those channels, looks like what you will find under a 30$ vans.\nAll i am saying is, i thought this is going to be good \"quality\" shoe. Birks used to be simple shoes with great foot bed and upper making them as good as they are. I also run, so i know about shoe mileage and that's not my complaint. I never complained about the outsole wear which is normal or the midsole losing the cushion. The upper wear is not good. I have other suede and nubucks which wear better and have lasted longer."
"Look around for an online store that does this. You pay to ship them to the cobbler, and they pay the return postage. The last time I had my clogs redone it was about $90, which was about $50 less than a new pair. This was pre covid, so prices may have changed.","My husband lovesssss Birkenstocks and goes through about 2 pairs a year, I'm a little lighter on the feet and get about 2 years out of pair.. But, 15?? That sounds insane. Granted we live in the tropics and wear ours almost everyday.","Fun fact crocs are actually comfortable 😂😂😂😂😂😂","I wanted to love the Boston clogs since they’re everywhere but unfortunately they’re not it for me :( but glad you found your pair!","When you got a meeting at 4:00 and a hot date with a boulder at 5:00","","Yeah, I’ve found all of their closed-toe shoes to be narrower than the sandals (with the few exceptions that have the full cork footbed w the shoes basically wrapped around them: London, Montana, Alabama, others?).","They look cool to me, therefore I assume they don’t come in a 38R, like most everything else I’ve considered recently.","Also are they heavy? I bought some adidas a while ago and they’re just too heavy to be walking around with.","","Bend actually has lots of cork in the sole. Rose Anvil on YouTube dissected the Oswego with the same outsole construction and the footbed is cork also.","Wishing you pain free days in your new shoes!","Hey, how are the Gary's holding up? im interested in those","What’s the verdict???","Congrats on your new pair :) please come back and let us know how they are :D","Again, my problem is not the upper splitting, or upeer wearing out. My problem is that there is no cork there and they pretend like there is. For 140, there's better things out there and sticking a layer of cork on the sides to make it look like there's a thick cork midsole is a cheap shot; as expressed in another comment above. They should either reduce the price on it and just make it all rubber or add a decent midsole and even raise the price. I am assuming (conspiracy!) with the new PE buyout and IPO, they are trying to release these models with higher margins and resting on the laurels of old Arizona quality. Not long before they screw the value proposition."
"Mine have lasted ten years. I wear them every winter (only gets as low as 30s usually around me) as I wear them with thick socks. Too stubborn to wear shoes a lot of the time. They’ve lasted me a long time with no issues.","Of course! Other than the upper, which is usually leather, there is no part of a Birkenstock shoe that cannot be repaired, replaced, and maintained. These last a lifetime if you know a good cobbler and do a bit of upkeep once or twice a year.","Not in my case .may be croc lite are soft.","They are a....look, haha. But I love a closed toe as I spend sooo much time baking. Enjoy your lovely St Barths.","Waaaait these kind of go hard! Love the styling with the pants too. The remind me of climbing shoes turned street wear","","If they want to cut corners on not providing the full cork footbed, whatever, but I don’t understand why they don’t at least keep the toe box shape the same?","True, the smallest size is 39","They aren't heavy, but I had to sell my pair. My flat feet just couldn't break them in, even after several months of wearing them.","","I have them in white leather, black leather, brown leather, grey leather and navy suede and like them all. I wore the brown leather ones on a 10 day trip to Egypt and walked miles in them.","Same! About both kyotos and hoping you have pain free days!","They’re doing good. I only wear them to work sometimes but they’ve held up great.","So they fit like Boston burkinstocks, feel a bit too big. Next time, I will order a size smaller. This is the same size I normally order. All and all I really like them. Good quality and comfortable","Sure","Thank you for taking the time though.. never thought someone could get this emotional about this post hahaha"
"I’ve had mine since freshman year of highschool in Florida and they are worn constantly, only just started cracking but I bought a second pair for now to ease the burden on that first pair.","The things are expensive for a reason. They’re sustainable and meant to last. If you don’t like the Birkenstock outsole, ask your cobbler to put on a different one. My bostons have vibram soles which are more durable.","Yes crocs lite","The most perfect birks 😍","I think you style them very well with those pants but specifically from the back I still think they are absolutely hideous :D","","My guess is that the toe box would be too big/wide to appeal to most consumers. I think that because the Birkenstock sandals are iconic they sell well and people aren't put off by the foot shaped toe box. But shoes which are wide enough to allow your toes to properly splay out would look too much like clown shoes to most people?","Did you go the same size as your Arizona’s? I heard these run roomier/bigger.","They are incredibly comfortable! I’m on my second pair. I find they don’t last long (painted leather is very tough to clean and scratches easily). But, worth the comfort. I wear them almost daily in the summer/spring/fall!","","Ma ti si veliki baja sa svim tim tikama, a karaš li ti nešto jer imaš šest pari tog sranja?","I like the black ones too. The ability of custom fit with the Velcro styles is something I enjoy !","Thanks for posting. I've been hoping rose anvil would do a video like this. We get a lot of questions in this sub specifically about the shoes, and posts about quality issues, so it's nice to be able to link people to rose anvil so they can see for themselves what the problems are.","Same, I bought a pair and these run WAY BIGGER THAN NORMAL, have to exchange for a smaller size","Please 🙏 do! I've been eyeing them too, and I'm curious how they wear. My gf thinks they're ugly, but she's not the one wearing them. I'm a fan of the look.","Yes re-reading I did go a little overboard. Ok, a lot overboard. I guess until they are cut open by someone it will be hard to determine exactly what level of cork is in there. I thought it was a pretty good amount but I'm open to being scrutinized until there is solid evidence. Hard to tell from your picture. I've only crossed over into their sneakers, boots, and shoes recently and so far so good comfort wise so maybe I'm on a biased sandal-high after four years? Suppose I'm just expecting the same from all their models. My feet feel so much better regardless. The way my sandals mold to my feet has made me a bit nuts in a good way. I wear a 42 so maybe I get lucky a lot on getting insane deals, but I've never paid over $80 and I would never pay full price. If I did my expectations might be higher. I guess we all need to find the inflection point of what we are willing to pay and what we feel each model is worth?"
"I feel the quality of the cork has degraded some how.. the heels crack faster","It’s really sad how disposable everything has become since the 20th century. Things used to be made for life, and people had less crap. You had a few shirts hand-made by a tailor. A pair or two of nice shoes made by a cobbler. A straight razor you could shave with for life and even hand down to your son. A cast iron pan that can cook for hundreds of years if maintained. The list goes on. To think we now buy clothes made of cheap crap and THROW THEM AWAY once they get a hole or stain is freaking insane!","","Where did you try them on in Singapore OP?","Kinda like putting a rugged cover on your smart phone, Birkenstock have applied this concept to a pair of Bostons?","","I have multiple pairs of Birk shoes/boots and like all of them. I wear my usual size (40N) in all of them. If you have any specific questions, let me know. :)","Yes same size","I got my first pair just 2 days ago! Been enjoying them a lot, I have the black leather version. Still working on breaking them in but it hasn’t been painful for me yet. I love the wide toebox, as someone with wide flat feet.","","Incredible shoes. Break in isn’t bad at all. Its the only sneaker i wear now. Bought a second pair as a backup for when its time to retire the first pair.","Did you end up getting the uji’s? Thoughts???","I have two pairs of the Laramie low and they are the best shoes I own. The casual shoes seem to be tricking people into thinking they have special cork features or whatever but the oxford lace ups are really great.","How many sizes did you have to go down?","Did you purchase these from a reputable distributor?  I'm curious how you can purchase them for less than half of their retail price?  If so I'd really like to know where you bought them cuz I would love the pair but can't justify spending $210.","Last thing I wanted to mention/ask...were you disappointed with the comfort, feel of your Callan the whole time, or just until you looked inside after they came apart and realized it wasn't full cork? Because so far the 2 pair I have feel really great. That's not to sound as snarky as it reads...legitimately wanting to know if you didn't like them the whole time. Thanks"
"My wife bought a pair probably 5 years ago and the soles on the heel are non existent now. I can’t remember the price but I think it was like $150? Not a bad bargain when $150 tennis shoes last 6-12 months if you wear them daily but definitely not BIFL like welted boots that can be resoled. (Redwings, whites, nicks etc.)","Edit: omg just looked up the only place that does it here and its 175$ to have them re-soled! Its unfortunately cheaper to just buy a brand new pair. I get doing it for environmental reasons or even sentimental reasons but i can't see myself spending 175$ to have them re-soled unless that new sole really would be that good.","","Suntec City","I like them! First impressions were that they look very durable and rugged. Please put some miles on to them and give us an update down the road on how they wear.","","Bend Low (white and black), Bend Midi (white). Extremely comfortable. Initially, they felt a bit too big so I wore two pairs of no-show socks with them. After I broke them in, the shoes fit perfectly. I like the basic style of them and wear these all of the time.","Those sandals mean business! I really like how sturdy they look","I love them. I especially love the high tops as they seem less heavy, which probably makes no sense. I have four pairs: two low and two high tops.","","I have the Bend Low Decon (mink) since 1st May and I'm using them almost everyday. They are my 1st Birkenstock. I fell in love with the brand and yesterday I ordered a pair of Milano (habana).","I did. I really haven’t worn them much yet but plan to wear them when it’s warmer. Still cool enough where I am for Kyotos.","No one is buying Birkenstock shoes...","I wear a half size so I originally ordered a size down since they don't make half sizes which was huge, so I exchanged for another size smaller which fits perfect","They are preowned, I bought them from a private seller on vinted.it (a platform similar to poshmark)",""
"Why not get them resoled? Sometimes you can even do a partial resole if it is just the heel","I so agree!!!! Im big into r/buyitforlife for all of the same reasons you've stated.","","How have these broken in for everyone? Have worn them once and can’t say they’re super comfortable. Don’t want to make any snap judgements though if they will start to loosen/soften like the cork soles do","Sure","","Ebba boot (black). I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable these are.","I love them. But you and I tend to like the styles that this sub considers less popular or even ugly.","I have Bend high and leather Arran and I'm happy with them. They're comfortable - but nothing will help for a lot of walking in the same shoes, imo one needs to alternate between pairs to give the feet somewhat of a rest from rubbing/pressing at the same spots.","","I have flat feet and the break in with the Bend Low has been easy IMHO. After maybe 2 days I was already comfortable in using them for the entire day.","I think Birkenstock got a great deal on Velcro as they seem to be pushing it hard lately.","Clearly people are or they wouldn't continue making them, hence videos like this to stop people wasting their money on them","How do you like them overall?","How are you liking them so far?  Comfort, fit etc?  I'm really thinking of pulling the trigger to wear as work shoes (chef).",""
"Resoling typically costs anywhere from $100-150...basically the same price as a brand-new shoe. I'm also not an expert but since the sole isn't welted on but rather uses cement, I'm not even sure a resole on Birkenstocks is possible. It's the same issue a company like Thursday Boots runs into, their boots are priced at $200 compared to the competition around $350+ and they get there by cutting corners to bring their prices down to a more affordable level but why resole a cheap boot when you can just buy a new pair every 3-4 years for the same price of a resole. High quality boots that costs $350+ will last a lifetime because a $100-$150 resole is justifiable since the price of a new shoe is 3x more expensive than a resole. I'm not hating on Birkenstocks, I like them but I think the BIFL concept on them is misguided. Getting 5 years out of a shoe is REALLY solid but only the top boot and dress shoe brands I would consider as BIFL.","Shoots i dont even know if we have a cobbler here but that would be smart because my footbed and straps are in fine condition - my cork is a little cracked but not to major. I also can't always avoid getting them wet because rain is just a constant part of life where i live. But i can probably be better about re-sealing the cork and get a more durable sole!! This is a great suggestion.","","The soles have not softened, and they are heavier than your usual Birks so it's not going to be as comfortable. I only really started to enjoy wearing them about 2 months in, and that's with infrequent wear (maybe twice a week..?)","I freaking love them","","Lahti boot (black). I received these last week and haven't worn them yet. They fit me exactly like Uggs but with the Birkenstock sole insert. These are currently on sale on the Birkenstock website.","Thanks für the review!","Strongly recommend! They were my go-to for so long.

However, there are two possible downsides to consider: I have a suspicion the leather is laminated (it doesn’t feel like full grain) and the heel support inserts (the things between outer leather and inner lining that give structure to the shoe around your heel) tend to break fast and easy. My wife had her shoes for just over 2 years and the heel support is completely gone - the inserts fell apart into pieces (she does unlace and uses shoe horn every time).

I liked them at first, very sturdy, then got caught in the rain a couple times in them and they literally started falling apart and the arch support became way too pronounced over time as my heel sunk deeper into the footbed. They say the footbed moulds to your feet but that's total nonsense. All that happens is as I've said, the main points of weight on your feet being the heel and ball of the foot sink in over time where as the arch stays high which just increasing the arch more and more.

"I’ve had several Birkenstocks through the years. They’re very comfortable, but they do make my feet sweat, and then the sandals get smelly!

"It seems like they no longer make them to last forever. I just looked and many are fake leather. The souls of the shoes are different too. I’m not sure but I’m hard on shoes and my last pare lasted only a year, but I wore them everyday in mud, rain, dirt, and heat around 108 in summer months. Im supper hard on shoes. I torture shoes. My Tivas lasted longer till a neighbor dog ate them, but were so not as comfortable. Now that I quit smoking and have a few years on me I might try them again. I did wear them daily, so…..","If you are going to spend the money, try on at least six pairs in a shoe store. For example, let's say you think you wear a 38 regular. You should try on: 37 regular, 38 regular, 39 regular, 37 narrow, 38 narrow, 39 narrow.

"Birks and water don’t mix. I read of another person using a leather / water protector which helped this.","Birkenstocks (real, not knockoff) are worth it to me because they support my feet which are prone to metatarsalgia and plantar fasciitis. They also can be resoled at a cobbler thus extending the life and I can continue using the footbed that has moulded to my feet.","","","","","","Thanks!
